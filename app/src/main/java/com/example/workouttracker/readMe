# Android Project README

This README provides an overview of the Android project developed as a part of the university assignment. The project consists of several blocks, each implementing different functionalities and features. Here's an outline of the implemented blocks:

## Block 1: Navigation
In this block, navigation between screens was implemented using Intents. The project includes additional screens, and the navigation is triggered by a button click. Intent extras are used to pass data between screens.

Implemented features:
- Navigating from the Main Activity to the Push Activity and passing the name of the workout.
- Intents were used to navigate from one activity to the other.
- Retrieving and processing arguments in the destination activity or fragment.

## Block 3: RecyclerView and Lists
This block focuses on displaying a list of items using a RecyclerView and implementing necessary components such as adapters and view holders.

Implemented features:
- Integration of a RecyclerView in the Push Workout activity (and others).
- Creation of a custom adapter to populate the RecyclerView with items.
- Designing a list item layout to represent the content of each item.
- Utilizing view holders and the `findViewById()` method to access and bind views.
- Implementing item click functionality, to navigate to the detail activity.

## Block 4: Dialogs
In this block, the project includes the implementation of dialogs using the MaterialAlertDialog.Builder. The dialogs is triggered by clicking a FAB, and a Snackbar is triggered by clicking buttons within the dialog.

Implemented features:
- Displaying a dialog triggered by a Floating Action Button (FAB) in the Detail Activity.
- Creating a dialog using the MaterialAlertDialog.Builder and showing it.
- Adding content to the dialog body.
- Adding buttons to the dialog and displaying a Snackbar upon dialog button click.

## Project Structure
The implemented blocks can be found in the following activities and fragments:
- Main Activity: Implements Block 1 by navigating to the Push Activity and passing the workout name.
- Push Activity: Implements Block 3 by incorporating a RecyclerView and displaying contact names. It also allows navigation to the Detail Activity on item click.
- Detail Activity: Implements Block 4 by creating a dialog triggered by a Floating Action Button (FAB). Additionally, a Snack-bar is displayed upon dialog button click.
- The requirements for the main activity are mainly covered in the Main Activity and the Detail activity.

Please note that this README provides a brief summary of the implemented blocks and does not include every detail or code snippet.
